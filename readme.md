# ToolKit
This is a repository to store some tool kits created by Ke for the future use
### 1. _robot_transformation.py_ is mainly for some transformation between different frame or from pose vector to the pose matrix
### 2. _pointcloud_kit.py_ is mainly for the create of the pointcloud and the visualization of the pointcloud
### 3. _test_OF.py_ is a small demo to create the Optical Flow based on the opencv and some skills about how to show the image and use the keyboard to control the window, during this demo I use the [Tartanair dataset](https://theairlab.org/tartanair-dataset/) as the example, there is a customed tartanair data loader, if you wanna try this demo, first you should change the `INITIAL_DIR`.
